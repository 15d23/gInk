
#### Introduction

gInk is a tiny screen annotation software under Windows, made to help improving my presentations. The features are greatly inspired by another screen annotation software named Epic Pen, but even more easy to use. I personally do many presentations recently, so gInk is made with the idea kept in my mind that the interface should be as simple as possible and should not distract attention of both myself and the audience. Unlike many other softwares in the same category, you select from pens to draw things instead of changing individual settings of color, transparency and tip width everytime. Each pen is a combination of those attributes and is configurable to your need.

#### How to use

After running, an icon occurs in the system tray. Click the icon (or use a hotkey) to start drawing.  
Click the exit button or press ESC to exit drawing.
