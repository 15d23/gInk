#### Introduction

gInk is a tiny screen white board software under Windows, made to help improving my presentations. The features are greatly inspired by another white board software named Epic Pen, but even more easy to use.

#### Features

Interface very compact and intuitive.  
Select a pen instead of individual settings of color, transparency and tip width.  
Pens configurable.  
Inks rendered on dynamic desktops instead of a screen snapshot.  
Stylus w/ eraser, touch screen and mouse compatable.  
Pen pressure support.  
Hotkey support.  
Multiple displays support.  
Open source.
